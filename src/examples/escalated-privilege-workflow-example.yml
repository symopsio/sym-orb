  An example Circle CI setup with a prod deploy workflow that can be triggered from an after_escalate hook in your Sym implementation.
  Once approved, the CI user will execute the deployment step with elevated permissions as configured in the flow, and be deescalated
  upon completion or automatically in 1 hour.
